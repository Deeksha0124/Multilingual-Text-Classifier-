# üåç Multilingual Text Classifier

With so much text data being generated in different languages on social media, emails, and customer reviews, it becomes difficult to process, store, and analyse it efficiently. Traditional methods struggle with handling large amounts of multilingual data, making it slow and ineffective. So this project focuses on creating a web-based application to analyze multilingual customer reviews with automatic language detection, translation, sentiment analysis, and category prediction.

## Features

- Detects the language of the input text (supports 30+ languages)
- Translates non-English reviews to English before processing
- Predicts sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) with confidence scores
- Suggests relevant product categories (e.g., fashion, electronics)
- Provides suggested star ratings (1‚Äì5 stars)
- Allows voice input for quick review submission üé§
- Exports predictions as **CSV** or **JSON**
- Displays interactive charts for language and sentiment distribution
- Visualizes dataset analysis with downloadable summary charts
