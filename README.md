# üåç Multilingual Text Classifier

With so much text data being generated in different languages on social media, emails, and customer reviews, it becomes difficult to process, store, and analyse it efficiently. Traditional methods struggle with handling large amounts of multilingual data, making it slow and ineffective. 
So this project focuses on creating a web-based application to analyze multilingual customer reviews with automatic language detection, translation, sentiment analysis, and category prediction.
